## How does a wind power generator work?  
  Illustrate, explain and compare various types of wind generator according to
   -  Rotational axis of wind turbines
The two rotational axis of wind turbines are vertical and horizontal.
vertical turbine:
1.Blades catch the wind and spin
2.Mechanical energy is converted to electricity energy by the generator 
3.Cables carries electricity to transmission line
4.Direction of blades are controlled by computer system

Horizontal vs Vertical:
Direction of wind:
Horizontal turbines needs the wind to flow at a right angle to the blade , if the wind blows from a different direction than the blades are facing , the turbine will get less energy from the wind, while vertical turbines runs well regardless of the wind direction ,due to it vertical-axis design.
Wind energy efficiency :
Horizontal-axis turbines convert more of the wind’s energy into useful mechanical motion because the blades are perpendicular to wind direction, while in vertical turbines, the energy is only captured from the wind from the front side. 

   -  Isolated and grid-connected wind turbine
 On-Grid/grid connected:
Grid connected wind turbines may cause power quality problems
A home that is currently connected to a locally provided power source is considered “on-grid.”/grid connected . In this scenario a power-conditioning unit (inverter) that makes the turbine output electrically compatible with the utility grid is installed. Your turbine works in tandem with your electric utility to power your house. When the wind isn’t blowing, the utility supplies your electricity. But when it’s windy out, your personal wind turbine pivots to catch the best wind and provides clean, quiet electricity. When it generates more electricity than you need, your meter can actually spin backwards—which means you’re selling electricity back to the utility.

Off-Grid/isolated:
Systems not connected to a local utility supplier are known as “off-grid” systems. 
In much of the U.S., wind speeds are low in the summer when the sun shines brightest and high in the winter when less sunlight is available. Due to the alternating nature of peak operating times hybrid systems are ideal for producing consistent power. In case of emergency, off-grid systems normally have an engine-generator on hand.
 

   -  Electric generator used
Wind turbines uses either synchronous or asynchronous generators. The decision consideration is determined by cost, ease of maintenance, reactive power generation and excitation voltage. For offshore wind turbine, synchronous generators are preferred as they do not draw reactive power and could be easily made self-started.
synchronous vs asynchronous generators:
They both are capable to convert mechanical energy into electric energy in terms of active power.
However, synchronous generator is also capable to generate reactive power, which means it is also capable to generate and control the output voltage.
Synchronous generators are by far the great majority of power generators. They have their own magnetic field. It can be a permanent magnet or they have a field winding, in where a magnetizing current establishes the necessary magnetic field.
The rotor runs at a certain speed that is an integer multiple of the generated frequency. The number of magnetic poles will define this factor.
Asynchronous generator can’t generate their own magnetic field, so they need to be connected to the grid in order to be magnetized. They will consume reactive power for this purpose. They may also have a capacitor bank connected to them to supply the necessary reactive power.

   -  Output electricity (AC or DC)
Due to the use of alternator in wind turbines, the output electricity produced is naturally AC. but could also be DC due to variable wind speed, excess output will also be converted to DC by rectifier for storage in batteries . this will allow for peak demand that is greater than the generator capacity.  

   -  Ground or airborne
   Ground wind generator generates electricity on land by harvesting the wind. However, there is Airborne wind generator.
   An airborne wind turbine is a design concept for a wind turbine with a rotor supported in the air without a tower, thus benefiting      from more mechanical and aerodynamic options, the higher velocity and persistence of wind at high altitudes, while avoiding the          expense of tower construction.
   Challenges include safely suspending and maintaining turbines hundreds of meters off the ground in high winds and storms,                transferring the harvested and/or generated power back to earth, and interference with aviation.
